# HTML Assessment

## How It Works
Under the first header are three paragraphs with lorem ipsums by Riker, demonstrating the different formats text can take in HTML.

Under the second header is a table showing the scores for a football game, utilizing colspan and rowspan to show the different layering aspects by which one can use a table, as well as different coloring schemes by using style.

Under the third header are two lists that incorporate links and images for the two teams.

Under the last header are various aspects of interactivity for the user, such as radio buttons, submit buttons, and select drop menu, including an alert feature for die hard fans.

## Lessons Learned
Style can make your page look at least a little bit nicer, thanks, CSS!
You can set the length for a comments box.
You do not need to download images to your computer to incorporate images, you can use an html link to get images from other parts of the internet, provided the image links are still good.
